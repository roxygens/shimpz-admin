"""Integration wiring metadata for each keyset group.

One entry per `keyset` group (asserted complete by tests/test_catalog.py, so no field is ever
orphaned from the configuration API). `recreate_target` names the STATELESS sidecar that must be
recreated for a saved secret to take effect live (Phase C2) — `None` means "applies on next restart"
(the brain, stateful datastores, and no-consumer groups). `container_env_for` maps the `.env` key
names a human types to the ACTUAL env var names the target container reads (mirrors docker-compose.yml).
